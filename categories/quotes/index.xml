      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;inspiration-usually-comes-during-work-rather-than-before-it---madeleine-lengle&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Inspiration usually comes during work, rather than before it.&amp;rdquo; - Madeleine L&amp;rsquo;Engle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think of inspiration, we often imagine it as a bolt of lightning striking us out of nowhere. We imagine creative geniuses like L&amp;rsquo;Engle sitting in their studies, waiting for inspiration to strike before they can begin writing. But as L&amp;rsquo;Engle points out, this is not how inspiration usually works. Instead, inspiration comes while we are in the act of creating, rather than before it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In his book &amp;ldquo;Atomic Habits,&amp;rdquo; author James Clear discusses the importance of deconstructing habits and skills to understand how they work and how they can be improved. He also touches on the idea that deconstruction creates knowledge, while recombination creates value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The spirit of collaboration is penetrating every institution and all of our lives. So learning to collaborate is part of equipping yourself for effectiveness, problem solving, innovation and life-long learning in an ever-changing networked economy.&amp;rdquo; — Don Tapscott&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration has become an essential part of our lives, and it is only growing more crucial with each passing day. In today&amp;rsquo;s networked economy, individuals and institutions must learn to collaborate to remain effective, innovative, and competitive. In this quote, Don Tapscott, a renowned author, has captured the significance of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;every-once-in-a-while-a-new-technology-an-old-problem-and-a-big-idea-turn-into-an-innovation--dean-kamen&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation.” — Dean Kamen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Segway didn&amp;rsquo;t change the world how Mr. Kamen had visualized it would, it was indeed a big idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote from Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, beautifully captures the essence of innovation. In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced world, businesses and organizations are constantly seeking ways to foster innovation, and one proven method is through the use of internal hackathons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;you-never-change-things-by-fighting-the-existing-reality-to-change-something-build-a-new-model-that-makes-the-existing-model-obsolete---buckminster-fuller&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&amp;rdquo; - Buckminster Fuller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter a problem or challenge, our natural inclination may be to fight against the existing reality. We may try to change the system from within or push back against the status quo. But according to Buckminster Fuller, this approach may not be the most effective way to bring about real change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced world, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel like everything has already been done before. With so many people creating content, products, and services, it can be discouraging to think that there&amp;rsquo;s no room for your own unique contribution. However, as James Clear suggests, there is always room for quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But what does it take to innovate? According to Michael Dell, the answer is simple: collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a system that says there is no limit to people&amp;rsquo;s creativity. People don&amp;rsquo;t go to Toyota to &amp;lsquo;work,&amp;rsquo; they go there to &amp;rsquo;think.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; -Taiichi Ohno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a job done – and done well – the physicality of &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; is but a small part of the overall outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;software-innovation-like-almost-every-other-kind-of-innovation-requires-the-ability-to-collaborate-and-share-ideas-with-other-people---bill-gates&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people …&amp;rdquo; — Bill Gates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is often associated with individual brilliance and ingenuity. We often think of innovators as lone geniuses, working tirelessly in isolation to come up with groundbreaking new ideas. However, as Bill Gates suggests, innovation is actually a collaborative process that relies on the ability to share and exchange ideas with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of dreamers, and thank goodness for them; without dreamers, this would be one heck of a dull place we exist in. But to take those dreams and make them real is truly next-level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
