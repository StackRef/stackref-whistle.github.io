And in manufacturing—six sigma, all that stuff—you&amp;rsquo;re trying to reduce variation. The fundamental manufacturing paradigm is to reduce variation, and the fundamental creative, innovation paradigm is to increase it.&amp;rdquo; - Reed Hastings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-evolving landscape of business and technology calls for the need to innovate and adapt constantly. As companies strive to stay ahead of the curve, it becomes crucial for them to embrace the idea of variation. In his quote above, Netflix&amp;rsquo;s co-founder and CEO, Reed Hastings, encapsulates this idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a system that says there is no limit to people&amp;rsquo;s creativity. People don&amp;rsquo;t go to Toyota to &amp;lsquo;work,&amp;rsquo; they go there to &amp;rsquo;think.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; -Taiichi Ohno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a job done – and done well – the physicality of &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; is but a small part of the overall outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;software-innovation-like-almost-every-other-kind-of-innovation-requires-the-ability-to-collaborate-and-share-ideas-with-other-people---bill-gates&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people …&amp;rdquo; — Bill Gates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is often associated with individual brilliance and ingenuity. We often think of innovators as lone geniuses, working tirelessly in isolation to come up with groundbreaking new ideas. However, as Bill Gates suggests, innovation is actually a collaborative process that relies on the ability to share and exchange ideas with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
