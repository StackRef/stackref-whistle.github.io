&lt;p&gt;Innovation is the lifeblood of progress. It is what drives us forward and enables us to create new products, services, and technologies that make the world a better place. But what does it take to innovate? According to Michael Dell, the answer is simple: collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a system that says there is no limit to people&amp;rsquo;s creativity. People don&amp;rsquo;t go to Toyota to &amp;lsquo;work,&amp;rsquo; they go there to &amp;rsquo;think.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; -Taiichi Ohno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a job done – and done well – the physicality of &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; is but a small part of the overall outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;software-innovation-like-almost-every-other-kind-of-innovation-requires-the-ability-to-collaborate-and-share-ideas-with-other-people---bill-gates&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people …&amp;rdquo; — Bill Gates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is often associated with individual brilliance and ingenuity. We often think of innovators as lone geniuses, working tirelessly in isolation to come up with groundbreaking new ideas. However, as Bill Gates suggests, innovation is actually a collaborative process that relies on the ability to share and exchange ideas with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
