      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;software-innovation-like-almost-every-other-kind-of-innovation-requires-the-ability-to-collaborate-and-share-ideas-with-other-people---bill-gates&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people …&amp;rdquo; — Bill Gates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
