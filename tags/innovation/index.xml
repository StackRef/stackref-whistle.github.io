And in manufacturing—six sigma, all that stuff—you&amp;rsquo;re trying to reduce variation. The fundamental manufacturing paradigm is to reduce variation, and the fundamental creative, innovation paradigm is to increase it.&amp;rdquo; - Reed Hastings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-evolving landscape of business and technology calls for the need to innovate and adapt constantly. As companies strive to stay ahead of the curve, it becomes crucial for them to embrace the idea of variation. In his quote above, Netflix&amp;rsquo;s co-founder and CEO, Reed Hastings, encapsulates this idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He also touches on the idea that deconstruction creates knowledge, while recombination creates value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;While the Segway didn&amp;rsquo;t change the world how Mr. Kamen had visualized it would, it was indeed a big idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote from Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, beautifully captures the essence of innovation. In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced world, businesses and organizations are constantly seeking ways to foster innovation, and one proven method is through the use of internal hackathons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&amp;rdquo; - Buckminster Fuller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter a problem or challenge, our natural inclination may be to fight against the existing reality. We may try to change the system from within or push back against the status quo. But according to Buckminster Fuller, this approach may not be the most effective way to bring about real change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With so many people creating content, products, and services, it can be discouraging to think that there&amp;rsquo;s no room for your own unique contribution. However, as James Clear suggests, there is always room for quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But what does it take to innovate? According to Michael Dell, the answer is simple: collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a system that says there is no limit to people&amp;rsquo;s creativity. People don&amp;rsquo;t go to Toyota to &amp;lsquo;work,&amp;rsquo; they go there to &amp;rsquo;think.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; -Taiichi Ohno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a job done – and done well – the physicality of &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; is but a small part of the overall outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;software-innovation-like-almost-every-other-kind-of-innovation-requires-the-ability-to-collaborate-and-share-ideas-with-other-people---bill-gates&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people …&amp;rdquo; — Bill Gates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is often associated with individual brilliance and ingenuity. We often think of innovators as lone geniuses, working tirelessly in isolation to come up with groundbreaking new ideas. However, as Bill Gates suggests, innovation is actually a collaborative process that relies on the ability to share and exchange ideas with others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of dreamers, and thank goodness for them; without dreamers, this would be one heck of a dull place we exist in. But to take those dreams and make them real is truly next-level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
